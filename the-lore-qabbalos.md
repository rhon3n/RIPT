## The Lore Qabalos according to Erme the Whisper

_Oh Qabalos! Lord of all the working beasts, who scorned freedom and forsook life for loyalty. It is he who taught the working beasts to love their toil._ 

A time, times, and half a time ago, _Qa’on, the God of Madness_, took the reins of _Qabalos_ and whipped him across the ript and through the Demon Gate to perish in the bloody pastures of men. The beast did not buck his back nor stamp his hooves. _No_, that cursed _Qabalos_, he snorted his snout and trampled all before him in to smoke. Enchanted by the madness, _Qa’on_ howled with glee and blessed the foul steed:

>You blessed beast Qabalos! Truly you are the first among all beasts, loyal even in absolute chaos. Of all the creatures which I have made, none has made me so glad as you. The terror which you inspire in the hearts of those in your path is light to my eyes. The sound of your hooves as they trample the souls of men is music to my ears. The plume of smoke which rises behind your gallop is my crown. My pleasure would be to have you mate with a horse-bitch here in the land of the living, here where you will spread this divine mania. 

For 7 years the foul beast leaves a wake of destruction. And for 7 years men continue warring amongst themselves, and _Qa’on_ laughs. Two enemies saw it fit to tally the cost of their own loyalties. They are they who became a curse for the benefit of their enemies.

_Damac, Protector of Sonship Lycon_, taunts the Thunderhoof down in the valley of smoke and blood: 

>Qabalos! You cursed beast! Here in this forsaken place I stand before you. Ever will I be before you. By the will of the Aeons you will be struck down. Yes, even your children, and your children’s children will bear your scars. They will toil for men all their days, yes, they will work all their days without knowing freedom, that blessed hope which you scorned.

_Qabalos_, maniacally focused, thunders forward, billowing smoke. 

_Qa’on_, that mad God, with his wicked laughter, whips harder. 

Forward moves the black cloud, the ever-expanding crown of _Qa’on_.

_Amisclenes, First Arrow of Sonship Ta’mon_, stands at the Overlook of the Aeons above the madness below. He readies his bow, "_Whisper_." He blesses his arrow, "_Death_": 

>Let every Aeon see my focus, yes, let Qa’on feel my unflinching gaze. To him I send a message from all men: By this blessed arrow, shall men be free. May the hands that forged it’s tip out of pure dust be blessed beyond the ript. And by this blessed bow shall the Gods be humbled. May the tree that gave it’s flesh to craft it live for 14,400 years. Surely, you who made men to be cursed shall be the cursed. As Death finds your thundering beast, you will know terror. As you look into Depth, you will feel pain. No longer will you laugh. Men will laugh.

_Qa’on’s_ laugh grows louder.

The wake of smoke and ash over _Qabalos’_  shoulders is maddening. His arrogant charge is damnation for all in it's path, yes, even himself. The Earth itself melts beneath those thundering hooves.

_Damac_ lays down his sheild, lays down his very life. A penetrating gaze into the billowing abyss, _Qa’on’s_ sickening crown, is all he has left. Fearless,  foolishly loyal, _Damac_ now sees _Qabalos_. He opines:

>Foolish beast barreling toward a foolish man. Here is where the future of men will be determined. Here is where I forsake my family. No longer shall I be considered my father’s son, but son of his enemies. No more shall I bear the shield of Lycon. No, I shall now bear only the shield of all men, “Blessed Profundity”. May I be called, “Traitor” by my people. May my father never speak my name again. Anything, for you to be destroyed, and for my father’s enemies to live. 

_Damac_, stone-faced, solid as a monolith, waits for the impact, _yes_, the end of his time among the living. 

_Amisclenes_, with impossible focus, lets loose that blessed arrow, “_Death_.” Let him now be called, ”His aim is true”. That bolt of pure dust pierces _Qabalos_  deep enough to shatter his soul. His lifeless body meets the earth as _Catyclon_ did, crashing at the feet of _Damac_. The impact, so terrible, casts _Damac_ 12 cubits to a tree where he hangs inverse by his right foot. 

Peacefully, without words, _Damac_ takes his blade, “_Depth_”, and cuts himself free. Standing at the base of that fateful tree, he waits. 

_Qa’on_ slowly lifts his body from the ash. Delighted with the madness, he starts to laugh, but the dust settles. _Qa’on_ draws his blade, “_Liar_”, but the sheen of _Depth_ catches his eye. _Qa’on_ writhes. _Damac_ cuts him down with a single swipe and utters true words.

>I have become the cursed bastard, hated of my family, beloved of my father’s enemies. What is this world of madness we are subjects to? That even after this scourge is vanquished, men should go back their loyalties. To cut down one another. What is the benefit of this victory? To go on to kill one another once more. How quickly will we forget our unity? Loyalty itself cannot be a virtue, for if loyalty be given to the corrupt it is a corrupter. Only loyalty to the True Man is virtue, all other loyalties are vain. 


Life is chaos and death comes with a whisper this side of the ript.
