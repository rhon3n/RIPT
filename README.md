# RIPT

First of all, it's pronounced exactly like the english word "rift"—_The "p" in some scandanavian languages makes the "f" sound when it precedes either an "s", "k" or "t"._

RIPT is a story of mankind, long ago. It takes place on earth tens of thousands of years ago—you can think of it as an exploration of the idea of a Pre-Diluvian global civilization and ensuing cataclysm. The zeitgeist of this global culture is one of materialism, greed, and progress at all costs. Most people do not feel connected to a spiritual element of themselves and in fact, will ridicule others who do as "loonies" or "quacks".

It is a passion project of Joel Rhine and will be ongoing as long as he is working on it.
